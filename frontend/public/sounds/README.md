# Sound Files

Place audio files here for the Body Scan feature.

## Required File

- `scan-sound.mp3` - Sound effect that plays during the body scan
  - Format: MP3
  - Duration: Can loop (3+ seconds recommended)
  - Style: Sci-fi/futuristic scanning sound

## Optional

- `ambient-background.mp3` - Background ambient sound for EchoBody scene
- `scan-complete.mp3` - Sound effect when scan completes

## Note

If the scan-sound.mp3 file is not found, the app will continue without audio (graceful fallback).
